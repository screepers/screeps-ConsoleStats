# Setup

* Add statsConsole.js and ascii-char.js to your project. NOTE: geohash.js is optional and is experimental.

* Modify the myStats array to plug in your cpu stats from your profiller.

# Notes

* If you don't wish to use the geohash parts, just comment them out and don't use the geohash.js
* You will have to customize it for how you collect stats.
